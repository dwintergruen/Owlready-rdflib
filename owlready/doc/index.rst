Welcome to Owlready's documentation!
************************************

Owlready is a module for ontology-oriented programming in Python: load OWL 2.0 ontologies
as Python objects, modify them, save to OWL XML, and perform reasoning via HermiT
(included). Owlready allows a transparent access to OWL ontologies (contrary
to usual Java-based API).

Owlready has been created at the LIMICS reseach lab,
University Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cit√©, INSERM UMRS 1142, Paris 6 University, by
Jean-Baptiste Lamy. It was developed during the VIIIP research project funded by ANSM, the French Drug Agency;
this is why most examples in this documentation relate to drug ;).

Owlready is available under the GNU LGPL licence v3.
